## Credits

## Introduction
I conducted a case study on a digital music store using SQL queries, delving into the database creation process and extracting insights from the data. Music reflects our diverse tastes and evolving trends, blending creativity, technology, and audience preferences. Inspired by the insights from Spotify Wrapped, which showcases global music engagement, I aimed to explore patterns, genres, and artists that shape our collective musical experience.

## Objectives
In this project, I aim to explore the complexities of the music industry by analyzing various facets including sales, customer behavior, genre and artist popularity, global trends, playlists, and employee dynamics.

## Tools 
- PostgreSQL, pgAdmin4
- SQLite, DB Browser for SQLite
