### Credits
Throughout the development of this project, I drew inspiration from a key video resource: [https://youtu.be/VFIuIjswMKM](https://youtu.be/VFIuIjswMKM).

### License
You can use this dataset to build your own project and practice your SQL skills.

### Introduction
I conducted a case study on a digital music store using SQL queries, delving into the database creation process and extracting insights from the data. Music reflects our diverse tastes and evolving trends, blending creativity, technology, and audience preferences. Inspired by the insights from Chinook Music Database, which showcases global music engagement, I aimed to explore patterns, genres, and artists that shape our collective musical experience.

The project also analyzes datasets, including Employee, Customer, Artist, Playlist, Playlist Track, Album, Track, Invoice, Media, and Genre. The study covers questions from basic to advanced, offering valuable insights into SQL and data analysis.

Overall Goal: Find Insights and find answer of the questions

### Objectives
In this project, I aim to explore the complexities of the music industry by analyzing various facets including sales, customer behavior, genre and artist popularity, global trends, playlists, and employee dynamics.

### Tools 
- PostgreSQL, pgAdmin4
- SQLite, DB Browser for SQLite
- Power BI

### Installation
To work on this project, you need to install a SQL supported RDBMS. For this project, PostgreSQL is used follow this step:
- Export Database to SQL and CSV file
- Create and Restore Database
- Create tables using the Schema Diagram provided below photo
- Develop SQL query
- Connect Power BI Desktop
- Visualization

## Steps of the Project
1. Database Setup: Understand the structure of the music store database and generate SQL queries to create the necessary tables.<br>
2. Data Analysis: Use SQL queries to analyze the data deeply, identifying patterns, trends, and relationships in the music industry.<br>
3. Drawing Insights: Derive meaningful insights from the analysis to meet the project's goals and objectives.<br>
